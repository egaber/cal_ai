# Cloud Events Implementation Status

## ✅ Completed

1. **EventService** (`src/services/eventService.ts`)
   - Firestore integration with optimistic UI updates
   - CRUD operations for events
   - Real-time sync with `subscribeToEvents()`
   - Background save operations

2. **EventContext** (`src/contexts/EventContext.tsx`)
   - React context for managing events
   - Auto-loads events from Firestore
   - Real-time updates across components
   - Error handling with toast notifications

3. **App.tsx**
   - EventProvider wraps the application
   - Events available via `useEvents()` hook

4. **Firestore Security Rules**
   - Family members can manage events
   - Proper authentication and authorization

## ⚠️ Partial - Index.tsx

The Index.tsx file currently uses local state with `useState` for events. To complete the migration:

### Required Changes:

```typescript
// Replace this:
const [events, setEvents] = useState<CalendarEvent[]>([]);

// With this:
const { events, createEvent, updateEvent, deleteEvent, moveEvent, loading } = useEvents();
```

### Update these handlers:

1. **handleCreateEvent** → Use `createEvent()` from context
2. **handleEventUpdate** → Use `updateEvent()` from context  
3. **handleEventDelete** → Use `deleteEvent()` from context
4. **handleMoveEvent** → Use `moveEvent()` from context
5. **handleInlineEventSave** → Use `createEvent()` from context

### Remove:
- Local `events` state
- `useEffect` that saves to StorageService
- `StorageService.saveEvents()` calls

## 🚀 Quick Fix

For now, the app will work with local storage. To enable cloud storage:

1. Replace event handlers in Index.tsx to use `useEvents()` hook
2. Remove local state management
3. Events will automatically sync to Firestore
4. All family members will see the same events in real-time

## Testing

Once integrated:
1. Create an event → Should appear instantly
2. Check Firestore console → Event should be saved
3. Open app on another device → Event should appear
4. Edit/delete → Changes sync in real-time

## Benefits of Cloud Storage

- ✅ Events persist across sessions
- ✅ Shared between family members
- ✅ Real-time sync across devices
- ✅ Instant UI updates (optimistic)
- ✅ Automatic conflict resolution
