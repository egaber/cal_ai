# Flutter Setup Instructions

## Flutter SDK is Not Installed

The Flutter app has been created, but Flutter SDK needs to be installed on your system to run it.

## Installation Options

### Option 1: Install Flutter SDK (Recommended for Development)

1. **Download Flutter SDK**
   - Visit: https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install/windows
   - Download the latest stable Flutter SDK for Windows
   - Extract to a location like `C:\flutter`

2. **Add Flutter to PATH**
   - Add `C:\flutter\bin` to your system PATH environment variable
   - Restart your terminal/VS Code

3. **Run Flutter Doctor**
   ```bash
   flutter doctor -v
   ```
   This will check your environment and show what's needed.

4. **Install Dependencies and Run**
   ```bash
   cd flutter
   flutter pub get
   flutter run -d chrome
   ```

### Option 2: Use Online Flutter Development Environment

While Flutter SDK downloads, you can preview the code structure:

1. **DartPad** (Limited - for small code snippets)
   - https://dartpad.dev

2. **Online IDE Options**:
   - GitHub Codespaces (if repo is on GitHub)
   - IDX by Google (https://idx.dev) - Full Flutter support
   - Zapp (https://zapp.run) - Flutter web preview

### Option 3: Wait for Flutter Installation

The project is fully set up and ready. Once Flutter is installed, simply:

```bash
cd c:\eyalg_repo\cal_ai\flutter
flutter pub get
flutter run -d chrome
```

## What's Already Created

✅ **Project Structure**
- Complete memory bank documentation
- pubspec.yaml with all dependencies
- analysis_options.yaml for code quality
- README.md with full documentation
- main.dart with iOS-native UI

✅ **Working Features** (once Flutter runs)
- Bottom tab navigation (Todos, Calendar, AI Chat)
- iOS Cupertino widgets throughout
- Empty state with floating action button
- Riverpod state management setup
- Ready for data models and business logic

## Current Project State

└── SETUP_INSTRUCTIONS.md   ✅ This file
```

## What You'll See When It Runs

The app will open with:
1. **Bottom navigation** with 3 tabs
2. **Todos tab** showing:
   - "No tasks yet" empty state
   - Blue circular '+' button at bottom right
   - iOS-style navigation bar with search icon
3. **Calendar tab** - Placeholder (coming soon)
4. **AI Chat tab** - Placeholder (coming soon)

## Next Development Steps

After Flutter is installed and running:

1. Create Task data model (Dart version of TypeScript Task)
2. Build TodoItem widget with circular checkbox
3. Build TaskDrawer for task details
4. Implement TimeBadge with color coding
5. Set up Hive for local storage
6. Configure Firebase sync

## Quick Start After Installation

```bash
# Navigate to flutter directory
cd c:\eyalg_repo\cal_ai\flutter

# Get dependencies
flutter pub get

# Run on web browser (instant preview)
flutter run -d chrome

# Or run on iOS simulator (if on Mac)
flutter run -d ios

# Or run on Android emulator
flutter run -d android
```

## Verify Installation

After installing Flutter:

```bash
flutter doctor -v
```

Should show:
- ✓ Flutter (stable channel)
- ✓ Windows Version (if on Windows)
- ✓ VS Code (with Flutter extension)
- ✓ Connected device or web browser

## Troubleshooting

### If you get errors about missing dependencies:
```bash
flutter pub get
```

### If you get build errors:
```bash
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

### If you need to generate code:
```bash
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs
```
