## Technical Debt 🔧

- None currently - fresh codebase

## Known Issues 🐛

- Date mutation in mock events (needs immutable updates)
- TypeScript warnings may appear in development
- Android blur effects need optimization testing

## Performance Metrics 📊

- Bundle size: TBD (will measure after build)
- App load time: TBD
- Animation FPS: Target 60fps (to be verified)

## Architecture Decisions 📐

### Technology Choices
- **Expo** over bare React Native for faster development
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **React Native Reanimated** for 60fps animations
- **date-fns** for date manipulation (lighter than moment.js)
- **Functional components** with hooks (no class components)

### Design Patterns
- **Component composition** for reusability
- **Centralized theming** for consistency
- **Type-safe props** for all components
- **iOS 26 design language** as visual foundation

### State Management
- Currently using local state (useState)
- Will add Context API for global state
- May consider Zustand for complex state later

## Lessons Learned 💡

1. **Liquid Glass Effect**: Required proper blur intensity values and semi-transparent backgrounds
2. **Animations**: React Native Reanimated worklets needed for smooth 60fps animations
3. **iOS Styling**: Following Apple HIG ensures familiar UX
4. **TypeScript**: Strong typing caught several potential bugs early

## Resources Used 📚

- React Native documentation
- Expo documentation  
- iOS Human Interface Guidelines
- React Native Reanimated docs
- date-fns documentation

## Timeline 📅

- **Project Start**: January 19, 2025
- **Foundation Complete**: January 19, 2025
- **Estimated Completion**: TBD

## Team Notes 👥

This is a personal/family project. The codebase is designed to be:
- Easy to understand
- Well-documented
- Maintainable
- Extensible for future features
