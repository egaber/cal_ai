# Task Scheduling MVP - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document tracks the implementation of AI-powered task scheduling system that enables users to capture tasks quickly and have the AI intelligently schedule them on the calendar.

## Completed Features (Phase 1 & 2)

### ✅ Phase 1: AI-Powered Task Scheduling (Core Flow)

#### 1.1 AI Assistant with Task Awareness
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `todoTaskService` import to AIAssistant component
  - Integrated `getTodosForAI()` to load all pending tasks
  - Updated system prompt to include task context
  - AI now receives full list of user's todo tasks with all metadata (tags, times, people, locations, etc.)

#### 1.2 `schedule_task` Calendar Tool
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Implementation**:
  - Added new tool definition to `CALENDAR_TOOLS` array
  - Created `handleScheduleTask()` method in CalendarService
  - Tool parameters include: taskId, suggestedStartTime, duration, memberId, category, priority, emoji, reasoning
  - Generates consistent event IDs based on task ID: `task-event-{taskId}`
  - Creates calendar events with source task link

#### 1.3 AI Scheduling Intelligence
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Implementation**:
  - Enhanced system prompt with task scheduling guidelines
  - AI considers:
    - Current calendar availability
    - Task priority and deadlines
    - Conflict avoidance
    - Buffer time between events (15 min minimum)
    - User preferences
    - Task grouping opportunities
  - Provides clear reasoning for scheduling decisions

### ✅ Phase 2: Bidirectional Task-Calendar Link

#### 2.1 TodoTask Type with Scheduling Fields
- **Status**: ✅ Complete
- **Implementation**:
  - Added `scheduledEventId?: string` - links to calendar event
  - Added `scheduledAt?: string` - timestamp of when scheduled
  - Added `rescheduledCount?: number` - tracks rescheduling history

#### 2.2 Update Task UI to Show Scheduling Status
- **Status**: ⏸️ Pending
- **Next Steps**:
  - Add visual indicator on task items showing scheduled status
  - Add clickable link to jump to calendar event
  - Show scheduled time on task card

#### 2.3 Two-Way Sync Logic
- **Status**: ✅ Partial Complete
- **Implementation**:
  - When AI schedules a task, it updates the task in Firestore with event ID
  - Event includes `sourceTask` field linking back to task
- **Remaining**:
  - Handle event deletion → update task status
  - Handle event time changes → notify user of reschedule
  - Handle task completion → optionally remove/complete event

## Remaining Phases

  - Notify user of urgent tasks
  - Suggest optimal scheduling
  - Alert about overbooked days
- [ ] 4.3 Add user preferences for monitoring
  - Quiet hours
  - Notification frequency
  - Priority thresholds

### Phase 5: Polish & UX Improvements

  - "Schedule all tasks" button
  - "Optimize my week" feature
  - Drag-and-drop task to calendar
- [ ] 5.2 Visual feedback enhancements
  - Loading states
  - Success animations
  - Calendar preview before scheduling
- [ ] 5.3 Bulk operations support
  - Select multiple tasks
  - Batch schedule
  - Smart grouping suggestions

## Technical Architecture

### Data Flow
```
User adds task → TodoTask created in Firestore
                          ↓
User asks AI to schedule → AI analyzes calendar + tasks
                          ↓
AI calls schedule_task tool → Creates calendar event
                          ↓
Event created with sourceTask link → Task updated with scheduledEventId
                          ↓
Calendar displays event ←→ Task shows scheduled status
```

### Key Files Modified
1. **src/types/task.ts** - Task type definitions
2. **src/services/todoTaskService.ts** - TodoTask type + Firestore operations
3. **src/services/calendarService.ts** - Added schedule_task tool
4. **src/components/AIAssistant.tsx** - Task-aware AI with scheduling logic

### Database Schema
```
families/{familyId}/members/{userId}/todos/{todoId}
  - id: string
  - rawText: string
  - completed: boolean
  - scheduledEventId?: string  ← NEW
  - scheduledAt?: string       ← NEW
  - rescheduledCount?: number  ← NEW
  - tags, timeBucket, etc.

families/{familyId}/events/{eventId}
  - id: string (e.g., "task-event-{taskId}")
  - title: string
  - startTime: string
  - endTime: string
  - sourceTask?: string        ← NEW (links to todoId)
  - ... other event fields
```

## How to Use (Current MVP)

### 1. Add Tasks
Navigate to the mobile tasks page and add tasks naturally:
```
"Buy groceries tomorrow at 5pm"
"Call mom on Friday"
"Finish report by end of week"
```

### 2. Ask AI to Schedule
Open AI Assistant and say:
```
"Schedule my tasks for this week"
"Find time for my grocery shopping task"
"What's the best time to call mom based on my calendar?"
```

### 3. AI Schedules Intelligently
The AI will:
- Analyze your current calendar
- Consider task priorities and deadlines
- Find optimal time slots
- Avoid conflicts
- Add buffer time
- Create calendar events
- Link events ↔ tasks

## Known Limitations & Future Improvements

### Current Limitations
1. No visual indicator on tasks showing they're scheduled
2. Can't click from task to see calendar event
3. No automatic rescheduling if event is moved
4. No Google Calendar sync for task-events
5. No proactive monitoring (user must ask)

### Planned Improvements
1. **UI Integration**: Show scheduled status on task cards with calendar icon
2. **Smart Notifications**: Proactive suggestions when new tasks added
3. **Conflict Resolution**: Auto-detect and suggest resolutions
4. **Learning**: Remember user preferences for scheduling patterns
5. **Batch Operations**: "Optimize my entire week" feature
